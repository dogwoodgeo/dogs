# Dog Map
This is a fun side project I developed to track the dogs I meet and interact with while living my life. Most are located in Central Arkansas, but with other regions included as I travel.

I use this project to experiment with aspects of web development, mostly relating to WebGIS and the *ArcGIS API for Javascript*. I used Esri's *ArcGIS Vector Tile Style Editor* to style the basemap.
